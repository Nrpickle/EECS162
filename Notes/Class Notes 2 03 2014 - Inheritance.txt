//This says that the wizard is derived from Character
class Wizard : public Character{

/*****
You still have to call the parent class' constructor. Lecture slide #12

Recommendation: Always explicitly invoke the base class constructor in the initialization section of the derived class constructor.

-Private member variables and member functions are inherited but not accessible to the derived class
-The derived class needs to call the public accessors and mutators of the base class to change private member variables

Protected member variables
-Protected member variables and member functions are accessible by: the class itself, and any derived classes

Note important difference
-Redefining a function definition in a derived class vs overloading a function
