Stream

--Output stream--
To append to file, use the following command: outStream.open("output.txt", std::ios::app);

Combination of decleration and open:
ofstream outStream("output.txt", std::ios::app);

Output is buffered, so you have to use [] to force a flush
outstream.flush();

You need to check and see if you opened your file correctly.
if( outStream.fail() ){
	cout << "Output file opening failed" << endl;
	exit(1); //Die, program, die!
}

--Formatting Output--
Floating point number (readable by humans)
outStream.setf(ios::fixed);

Setting the width
cout << setw(4) << 10 << setw(5) << 20
