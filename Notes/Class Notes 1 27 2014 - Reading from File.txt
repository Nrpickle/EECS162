Class Notes 1/27/2014

Example reading code from file:

std::ifstream inStream;
inStream.open("input.txt");
if( inStream.fail() )
{
  cout << "Input file opening failed. \n";
  exit(1);
}

int first, second, third;
inStream >> first >> second >> third;
cout << first << " " << second << " " << third << endl;
inStream.close();

You have to use a C-style string when using inStream.open()
-Use c_str() on string object to get c string


Alternate method:

[open file]
std::string next;
while(inStream >> next) {
  cout << next << " " << endl;
}
inStream.close();



//Hello world!
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
        
int main(){
  cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
  return 0;
}
